## About The Project:
### This project has the following objectives: 
#### 1. To make a Deep Learning model that will identify and assess the severity of knee osteoarthritis using Residual Networks.
#### 2.To develop a website in HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and Python will serve as a demonstration of the achieved outcome.
