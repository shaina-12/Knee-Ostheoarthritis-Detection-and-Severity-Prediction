                Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative knee 
                <br>
                joint condition characterized by gradual wear and 
                <br>
                strain and loss of articulatory cartilage. It 
                <br>
                is typically found in adults. The common clinical 
                <br>
                symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include knee pain that 
                <br>
                gradually becomes worse over time along with knee stiffness
                <br> 
                and swelling, pain after prolonged sitting or resting, and 
                <br>
                pain that worsens over time. The severity of the symptoms 
                <br>
                may differ from person to person. It affects more than 500 
                <br>
                million people which constitutes about 7% of the 
                <br>
                world's population with women disproportionately affected 
                <br>
                by the condition. From 1990 to 2019, there was a 48% rise 
                <br>
                in the cases of osteoarthritis globally, and in 2019 it 
                <br>
                accounted for 2% of all years lived with disability (YLDs) 
                <br>
                worldwide, ranking as the 15th most common cause of YLDs.

                Our aim is to give accurate analysis of Knee Osteoarthritis using  knee osteoarthritis
                <br>
                using Artificial Intelligence. This solutions can potentially enhance the lives of persons 
                <br>
                affected by this very frequent disease by helping and speeding diagnosis to deploy 
                <br>
                appropriate countermeasures.
