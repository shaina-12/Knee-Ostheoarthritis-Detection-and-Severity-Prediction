                The satisfaction that accompanies the successful completion of any task would be incomplete without the mention of people whose ceaseless cooperation made it possible, whose constant guidance and encouragement crowns all the efforts with success. We would like to thank Prof (Dr) Abhay Bansal, Head of Department â€“ CSE, and Amity University for allowing me to undertake this project. We would like to thank our faculty guide Prof. (Dr.) M. Parthasarathi, Board Members, NLP Professor and our parents who are the biggest driving force behind my successful completion of the project. They have always been there to solve any query of ours and guided us in the right direction regarding the project. Without their help and inspiration, we would not have been able to complete my project. We would also like to thank Nikhil J Dutta, Deepansha Adlakha, Leah Khan, Rahul Sawhney, Amartya Sumukh Varma, Harjot Kaur, Rakshit Walia and other batch mates and juniors who guided us, helped us, and gave us ideas and motivation at each step.
